# 🚀 DSA Placement Blueprint: 168 Days of Code

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** journey! This repository is a detailed, structured tracker of my daily coding progress. I am strictly following a 6-month intensive roadmap to master DSA from scratch and prepare for product-based company interviews.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a highly optimized problem-solving mindset, master DSA using **Java**, and crack technical interviews with consistency and discipline.

* **Start Date:** February 11, 2026
* **Target Completion Date:** July 31, 2026
* **Language Used:** Java ☕

## 📂 Repository Structure
This repository is strictly organized by **Topics** rather than days, ensuring clean navigation and professional readability. Each topic folder contains highly optimized code for specific problems. Day-wise progress is maintained strictly through Git Commit histories.
